      "faq1Question": "What's the difference between CBD pollen and resin?",
      "faq1Answer": "Pollen (or skuff) is generally drier and more crumbly, collected by sifting trichomes. Resin (or hash) is often pressed (hot or cold) from pollen or trichomes, resulting in a more compact, sticky, or oily texture.",
      "faq2Question": "How to use CBD resins and pollens?",
      "faq2Answer": "Temperature-controlled vaporization is the most recommended method to fully appreciate the aromas and effects. Infusion in a fatty substance (milk, oil) is also possible. Some also add them to cooking.",
      "faq3Question": "Are CBD resins stronger than flowers?",
      "faq3Answer": "Generally yes, as they are concentrates of cannabinoids and terpenes. The CBD level is often higher than in flowers, which can lead to effects perceived as more intense. Always start with a small amount.",

      "faq2Question": "Which CBD oil concentration should I choose?",

      "faq2Question": "What are the effects of CBD tea?",

      "faq3Question": "Do CBD creams have psychotropic effects?",
      "faq3Answer": "No. CBD itself is not psychotropic. Furthermore, topical application strongly limits the passage of CBD and other components (including traces of THC <0.3%) into the bloodstream, making any systemic or psychotropic effect improbable.",

      "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions about CBD Vaporizers",
      "faq1Question": "How does a vaporizer work?",
      "faq1Answer": "A vaporizer heats plant material (flowers) or concentrates (resins) to a controlled temperature (usually between 160°C and 220°C / 320°F and 428°F). This heat releases the active compounds as vapor, which is then inhaled, without burning the material.",
      "faq2Question": "What temperature should I use to vaporize CBD?",
      "faq2Answer": "The ideal temperature varies depending on preferences and products. Lower temperatures (160-180°C / 320-356°F) favor flavors, while higher temperatures (190-210°C / 374-410°F) extract more cannabinoids for potentially stronger effects. Experiment to find your optimal setting.",
      "faq3Question": "Is vaporization healthier than smoking?",
      "faq3Answer": "Vaporization is widely considered a healthier alternative to combustion (smoking). By avoiding burning the material, it eliminates the creation and inhalation of many toxic and carcinogenic substances found in smoke.",

    "subtitle1": "CBD : Le cannabidiol, qu’est-ce que c’est ?",
    "p1": "Le cannabidiol (CBD) est une molécule présente dans le chanvre et complète le spectre des 110 autres cannabinoïdes connus à ce jour. On lui connaît des vertus bien-être pour le sommeil, le stress, l’anxiété, les tensions musculaires, etc. On le retrouve sous forme de baume, d’huile ou de fleurs à infuser.",
    "subtitle2": "Comment connaître le taux de CBD/THC?",
    "p2": "Il est tout naturel de vouloir connaître les taux de CBD ou de THC présents dans les fleurs et les huiles de chanvre que nous vous proposons. C’est pourquoi chaque étiquette produit se verra apposer un QR code qui vous redirigera vers l’analyse associée, répondant aux procédures requises par l’arrêté 2004-02-24 art. 3 JORF du 21 mars 2004.",
    "subtitle3": "Comment utiliser du CBD ?",
    "p3": "Il n’y a pas une seule meilleure façon, tout simplement parce que chaque personne a un profil unique et particulier. La méthode la plus connue est l’infusion de la fleur de chanvre en incorporant un corps gras dans le mélange. Par exemple, vVous pouvez ajouter du beurre, de la crème ou encore de huile végétale (comme l’huile de coco) dans de l’eau frémissante à 90°C Laissez infuser 10 à 15 min. Servez.",
    "subtitle4": "Puis-je me faire livrer du CBD à domicile ?",
