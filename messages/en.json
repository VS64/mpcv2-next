      "faq2Answer": "Temperature-controlled vaporization is the most recommended method to fully appreciate the aromas and effects. Infusion in a fatty substance (milk, oil) is also possible. Some also add them to cooking.",
      "faq3Question": "Are CBD resins stronger than flowers?",
      "faq3Answer": "Generally yes, as they are concentrates of cannabinoids and terpenes. The CBD level is often higher than in flowers, which can lead to effects perceived as more intense. Always start with a small amount.",

      "faq3Question": "Do CBD creams have psychotropic effects?",

      "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions about CBD Vaporizers",
      "faq1Question": "How does a vaporizer work?",
      "faq1Answer": "A vaporizer heats plant material (flowers) or concentrates (resins) to a controlled temperature (usually between 160°C and 220°C / 320°F and 428°F). This heat releases the active compounds as vapor, which is then inhaled, without burning the material.",
      "faq2Question": "What temperature should I use to vaporize CBD?",
      "faq2Answer": "The ideal temperature varies depending on preferences and products. Lower temperatures (160-180°C / 320-356°F) favor flavors, while higher temperatures (190-210°C / 374-410°F) extract more cannabinoids for potentially stronger effects. Experiment to find your optimal setting.",
      "faq3Question": "Is vaporization healthier than smoking?",
      "faq3Answer": "Vaporization is widely considered a healthier alternative to combustion (smoking). By avoiding burning the material, it eliminates the creation and inhalation of many toxic and carcinogenic substances found in smoke.",
